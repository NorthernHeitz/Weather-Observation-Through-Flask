# Weather-Observation-Through-Flask
Python code to run weather observations every 5 minutes displaying output via Flask


Python Code using PYOWM to run weather obs every 5 minutes, and displaying reults on user defined LAN. Units currently used are Farhenheit for temperature, and inches of mercury for pressure. You must install pyowm, and flask, as well as get your own personal API key to pull the data. I personally use the free key which gives me evertyhing in this code plus a little extra.

Must change following to function -
Line 33 contains your API Key
Line 38 contains your City, State, Country
Line 83 contains your City, State
Line 130 contains your LAN Address and Port
