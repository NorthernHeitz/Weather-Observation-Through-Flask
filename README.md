# Weather-Observation-Through-Flask
Python code to run weather observations every 5 minutes displaying output via Flask


Python Code using PYOWM to run weather obs every 5 minutes, and displaying reults on user defined LAN. Units currently used are Farhenheit for temperature, and inches of mercury for pressure. You must install pyowm, and flask, as well as get your own personal API key to pull the data. I personally use the free key which gives me evertyhing in this code plus a little extra.
